Ncluster provides Python API to do the following things:
- Allocate AWS machine
- Upload file to machine
- Run command on machine
- Download file from machine

IE

```
import ncluster
task = ncluster.make_task(instance_type='p2.xlarge')
task.upload('myscript.py')
task.run('python myscript.py > out')
task.download('out')
```

Necessary AWS infrastructure is created on demand using defaults that make sense for research. IE, your machines are preconfigured for passwordless SSH, can access each other over all interfaces, and have a persistent file system mounted under /ncluster.


## Installation
Install pip, tmux, Python 3.6 (see below), and [write down](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z8lCZVWXs7XORbiNmBAsBDtouV3KwrtH8-UL5M-zHus/edit) your AWS security keys, then

```
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaroslavvb/ncluster/master/requirements.txt
pip install -U ncluster
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIBATdf343
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=z7yKEP/RhO3Olk343aiP
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```



## Command-line tools

```
ncluster
ncluster ls
ncluster hosts
ncluster ls
ncluster ls <substring>
ncluster ssh # connects to latest instance
ncluster ssh <substring>  # connects to latest instance containing <substring>
ncluster ssh \'<exact match>\'
ncluster mosh <substring> 
ncluster kill <substring>    # terminates matching instances
ncluster kill \'<exact match>\'
ncluster stop <substring>    # stops matching instances
ncluster start <substring>   # starts matching stopped instances
ncluster nano       # starts a tiny instance
ncluster keys   # information on enabling SSH access for your team-members

ncluster ssh_    # like ssh but works on dumb terminals
ncluster ls     
ncluster cat <fn>
ncluster cmd "some command to run remotely on AWS"

ncluster efs   # gives EFS info such as the mount command

nsync -m gpubox
nsync -m gpubox -d transformer-xl

nsync -d {target directory} -m {machine name substring}

nsync -m gpubox # syncs . to ~ on gpubox
nsync -d transformer-xl -m 4gpubox  # syncs . to ~/transformer-xl on 4gpubox


{substring} selects the most recently launched instances whose name contains the substring. Empty string is a valid substring. Skipping -t will sync to ~ on remote machine. Sync seems to be 1 way (from local -> remote)
```

### Extra
An example of installing pip/tmux/python 3.6 on MacOS

1. Download Anaconda distribution following https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html
2. Install tmux through homebrew: https://brew.sh/, then `brew install tmux`

Then

```
conda create -n new python=3.6 -y
conda activate new
```

Extra Deps:
```
